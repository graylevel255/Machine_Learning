# Overview

This repository contains the implementations of various Machine Learning models on both synthetic and real-world  datasets.

# Tasks

The following tasks are explored in this repository :
1) Regression (Univariate and Multivariate)
2) Eigen Analysis (Face reconstruction using PCA)
3) Comparing different Classification methods (both parametric and non-parametric including KNN, GMM, SVM)
4) Learning with Sequential Data/Speech Data using Hidden Markov Models
5) Multi-layer Feed Forward Neural Network

# Extra Inputs
Three PDF files are included that give details about the experimental study
